    "Use when the body still feels activated, tense, or restless after the standard body downshift protocol was followed.",
  focus:
    "Use long relaxed exhalation to reduce body activation without forcing the body into sleep.",
  steps: [
    "Sit comfortably rather than lying down at first.",
    "Breathe in normally.",
    "Breathe out slowly, as if blowing a candle that is far away from you.",
    "Make the exhale long, gentle, and relaxed. Do not force it.",
    "Do not hold your breath.",
    "Continue for 2–3 minutes.",
    "If the body settles, return to bed and stay low stimulation.",
    "If this does not work, another underlying factor may be affecting sleep.",

    "Do not force the exhale.",
    "Do not hold the breath.",
    "Do not do this standing if you feel lightheaded.",
